                <p>Uttarakhand has a total geographic area of 53,483 km², of which 86% is mountainous and 65% is covered by forest. 
                Most of the northern parts of the state are part of Greater Himalaya ranges, covered by the high Himalayan peaks and glaciers, while the lower foothills were densely forested till denuded by the British log merchants and later, after independence, by forest contractors</p>
                <br>
                <p>The unique Himalayan ecosystem plays host to many animals (including  bharal, snow leopards, leopards and tigers), plants and rare herbs. Two of the India's great rivers, the Ganges and the Yamuna take birth in the glaciers of Uttarakhand, and are fed by myriad lakes, glacial melts and stream.</p>
